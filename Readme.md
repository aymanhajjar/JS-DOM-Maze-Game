# JS DOM: Maze Game
A game made using JS, where the user must go through a maze without touching any wall.

### Details
The game uses eventListeners to check the position of the starting square. Once the square comes in contact with one of the walls, the game is restarted. If the user wants to reset the score, he has to click on the starting box. The box is not allowed to leave the maze, to prevent the user from going around the maze.
